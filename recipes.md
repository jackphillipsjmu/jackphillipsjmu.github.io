## A Play on Thai Curry

One of my favorite comfort foods to make on colder days. This recipe is influenced primarily by a friend of mine who made a rendition of it shortly after my Mom passed. I hope you can be comforted by it too and throw in your own personal touches.

### Ingredients
- Red Thai Curry Paste (2 tablespoons, _Panang is my Recommended Curry Paste_)
- Coconut Milk (Buy a Box, 33.8 oz or a few cans. Having Extra can help to Dilute the heat of the Curry if needed)
- Rice or Noodles to serve the goodness on top of _(1+ Cup of Rice, it's impossible to gauge the amount of Noodles so do what meets you and your guest needs)_
- 1 Yellow Onion (Diced)
- Green Onion (2-3 stalks, Thinly Sliced including White and Green bits)
- Garlic (Mince 2-3 or more Cloves, you can substitute with Garlic Powder if you'd like)
  - If you are a garlic lover like I am then put as much in as you like!
- Soy Sauce _(3 Tablespoons)_
- Fish Sauce _(Couple Dashes)_
- **Protein of Your Choice!** Here are some suggestions _(1 - 1.5 pounds cut into bite sized cubes)_:
  - Chicken Thighs _(has the fat content to not dry out)_
  - Pork
  - Beef
  - Tofu _(Firm)_
- Bok Choy or Other Leafy Green _(Swiss Chard is a nutritional powerhouse)_
- Bamboo Shoots or Shredded Carrots to provide some crunch. _**Note**: Peanuts are also good to throw on this dish for added crunch and fat content._
- Olive Oil/Any Cooking Oil you have
- Salt
- _(Optional)_ Thai Eggplant _(Cut into Quarters)_
- _(Optional)_ Sesame Oil _(Just a Dash or Two)_
- _(Optional)_ Lime _(Cut into Quarters)_

### Prep and Cook
- Dice the Yellow Onion.
- Heat up a Dutch Oven/Large Pot over medium-high heat with 1 - 2 Tablespoons of oil.
- Add in the diced Yellow Onion with a pinch of salt.
  - **Before you add the Onion!** Later on if you choose to use a blender to make the Curry Baser then set about a quarter of the Onion aside to blend.
- While the Yellow Onion begins to simmer prep the next step:
  - Thinly slice the Green Onion
  - Mince your Garlic
  - Roughly cut the Bok Choy into 1/4 inch slices including the leaves.
  - _**Optional:** If you grabbed some Thai Eggplant then cut them into quarters as well._
  - Cut the Protein/Tofu into bite sized pieces.
- Add the chopped Bok Choy to the Pot after the Yellow Onion is starting to become fragrant.
- Curry Base Options
  - **Using the Blender Method for Curry Base**
    - If you have a Blender handy add the Green Onion, Garlic, quarter of the Yellow Onion, 2 Tablespoons of Curry Paste, a splash of oil and about a half cup of Coconut Milk.
    - Throw in a couple dashes of Fish Sauce, Soy Sauce and _optional_ Sesame Oil for a flavor boost. Blend them together until it's a relatively smooth texture.
    - Pour the Blended mix into the Pot.
  - **Just the Pot Method for Curry Base**
    - If you do not want to use a blender then just add the Green Onion, Garlic and 2 Tablespoons of Curry Paste to your pot that is simmering the Yellow Onion.
    - Add in a half cup of Coconut Milk with a couple dashes of Fish Sauce, Soy Sauce and _optional_ Sesame Oil.
- Let the ingredients simmer for a few minutes then pour in any leftover Coconut Milk. _**Note: If you are using a blender you can add a little Coconut Milk to it and get all the little bits of missed ingredients. As a bonus it will aerate the milk.**_
- Add in your Protein of Choice and _optional_ Thai Eggplant the Pot.
- Stir and Cover the Pot to let the ingredients simmer and get to know each other without loosing much of the Coconut Milk due to evaporation.
- Stir occasionally over the next 10 - 15 minutes.
- Remove the lid from the Pot and let the Curry reduce stirring occasionally and try to scrape any bits on the bottom of the pan that may have formed. While it's reducing Prepare your Rice or Noodles.
- Add in your Bamboo Shoots, Carrots or Both to give a little crunch to the dish.
- While the Rice/Noodles are cooking taste the Curry. If it's too spicy for you or the people you are serving just add in more Coconut Milk to dilute it.
  - Try out putting a little bit of fresh Lime Juice into your samples. The citrus/acidity it adds can really make or break a dish.
- Once your Rice/Noodles are done check the Curry. If it has the consistency you're looking for then take it off direct heat, otherwise, let it reduce further stirring occasionally. _By leaving it on the heat source you will thicken the Curry just ensure you're not burning anything in the process._

### Serve
- Add your cooked Rice or Noodles to a bowl and cover with your curry.
- Adorn with a quarter of Lime to add to the dish as needed.
- **Enjoy!**
