## A Play on Thai Curry
One of my favorite comfort foods to make on colder days. This recipe is influenced primarily by one of my best friend's, KK, who made a rendition of it shortly after my Mom passed. I hope you can be comforted by it too and throw in your own personal touches.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Red Thai Curry Paste <em>(2 tablespoons, <strong>Panang is my Recommended Curry Paste</strong>)</em></li>
  <li>Coconut Milk <em>(Buy a Box, 33.8 oz or a few cans. Having Extra can help to Dilute the heat of the Curry if needed)</em></li>
  <li>Rice or Noodles to serve the goodness on top of <em>(1+ Cup of Rice, it&#39;s impossible to gauge the amount of Noodles so do what meets you and your guest needs)</em></li>
  <li>1 Yellow Onion <em>(Diced)</em></li>
  <li>Green Onion <em>(2-3 stalks, Thinly Sliced including White and Green bits)</em></li>
  <li>Garlic <em>(Mince 2-3 or more Cloves, you can substitute with Garlic Powder)</em><ul>
  <li><em>If you are a Garlic lover like I am then put more in! I&#39;m not the <strong>Garlic-Police</strong></em></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Soy Sauce <em>(3 Tablespoons)</em></li>
  <li>Fish Sauce <em>(Couple of Dashes, this will smell to some noses a bit odd, but, adds some &quot;Umami&quot; to the mix which you&#39;ll love when you&#39;re eating)</em></li>
  <li><strong>Protein of Your Choice!</strong> Here are some suggestions <em>(1 - 1.5 pounds cut into bite sized cubes)</em>:<ul>
  <li>Chicken Thighs <em>(has the fat content to not dry out)</em></li>
  <li>Pork</li>
  <li>Beef</li>
  <li>Tofu <em>(Firm)</em></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Bok Choy or Other Leafy Green <em>(Roughly Chopped, Swiss Chard is a nutritional powerhouse and is available most places)</em></li>
  <li>Bamboo Shoots and/or Shredded Carrots to provide some <em>crunch</em><ul>
  <li><em><strong>Note</strong>: Peanuts are also good to throw on this dish for added crunch and fat content.</em></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Olive Oil/Any Cooking Oil you have on hand</li>
  <li>Salt to taste</li>
  <li><em>(Optional)</em> Thai Eggplant <em>(Cut into Quarters)</em></li>
  <li><em>(Optional)</em> Sesame Oil <em>(Just a Dash or Two)</em></li>
  <li><em>(Optional)</em> Lime <em>(Cut into Quarters)</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Prep and Cook</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>Dice the Yellow Onion.</li>
  <li>Heat up a Dutch Oven/Large Pot over medium-high heat with 1 - 2 Tablespoons of oil.</li>
  <li>Add in the diced Yellow Onion with a pinch of salt.<ul>
  <li><strong>Before you add the Onion!</strong> Later on if you choose to use a blender to make the Curry Base then set a quarter of the Onion aside to blend.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>While the Yellow Onion begins to simmer prep the other ingredients:<ul>
  <li>Thinly slice the Green Onion</li>
  <li>Mince your Garlic</li>
  <li>Cut the Protein/Tofu into bite sized pieces.</li>
  <li>Roughly cut the Bok Choy into 1/4 inch slices including the leaves.</li>
  <li><em><strong>Optional:</strong> If you grabbed some Thai Eggplant then cut them into quarters as well.</em></li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add the chopped Bok Choy to the Pot after the Yellow Onion is starting to become fragrant.</li>
  <li><em><strong>Choose Your Path: Curry Base Options</strong></em><ul>
  <li><strong>Using the Blender</strong><ul>
  <li>If you have a Blender handy add the Green Onion, Garlic, quarter of the Yellow Onion, 2 Tablespoons of Curry Paste, a splash of oil and about a half cup of Coconut Milk.</li>
  <li>Throw in a couple dashes of Fish Sauce, Soy Sauce and <em>optional Sesame Oil</em> for a flavor boost.</li>
  <li>Blend them together until it&#39;s a relatively smooth texture.</li>
  <li>Pour the Blended mix into the Pot.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Just the Pot</strong><ul>
  <li>If you do not want to use a blender then just add the Green Onion, Garlic and 2 Tablespoons of Curry Paste to your pot that is simmering the Yellow Onion.</li>
  <li>Add in a half cup of Coconut Milk with a couple dashes of Fish Sauce, Soy Sauce and <em>optional Sesame Oil</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Let the ingredients simmer for a few minutes then pour in any leftover Coconut Milk. <em><strong>Note: If you are using a blender you can add a little Coconut Milk to it and get all the little bits of missed ingredients. As a bonus it will aerate the milk.</strong></em></li>
  <li>Add in your Protein of Choice and <em>optional Thai Eggplant</em> to the Pot.</li>
  <li>Stir and Cover the Pot to let the ingredients simmer and get to know each other without loosing much of the Coconut Milk due to evaporation.</li>
  <li>Stir occasionally over the next 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add in your Bamboo Shoots, Carrots or Both to give a little crunch to the dish.</li>
  <li>Remove the lid from the Pot and let the Curry reduce, stirring occasionally, and try to scrape any bits on the bottom of the pan that may have formed. <em><strong>While it&#39;s reducing Prepare your Rice or Noodles.</strong></em></li>
  <li>Once the Rice/Noodles are cooking <strong>taste the Curry</strong>. If it&#39;s too spicy for you or the people you are serving just add in more Coconut Milk to dilute it.<ul>
  <li>Try putting a little bit of fresh Lime Juice into your samples. The citrus/acidity it adds can really make or break a dish for some pallets.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once your Rice/Noodles are done check the Curry. If it has the consistency you&#39;re looking for then take it off direct heat, otherwise, let it reduce further stirring occasionally.<ul>
  <li><em>By leaving it on the heat source you will thicken the Curry just ensure you stir and scrape the bottom of the Pot for those tasty thangs that adhere to the bottom</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Serve</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add your cooked Rice or Noodles to a bowl and cover with your Curry.</li>
    <li>Adorn with a quarter of Lime to add to the dish as needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
</ul>

## Red Wine Reduction Sauce
